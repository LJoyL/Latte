# Latte 📝✨

**Latte** is an open-source Typst editing environment that combines the power of a code editor (like Overleaf) with the ease of a Word-style interface. It's designed for users of all levels — from Typst veterans to first-time users — to write beautiful documents faster and with more flexibility.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Live Typst Editor** – Real-time Typst editing with syntax highlighting and preview
- 🎨 **Visual (WYSIWYG) Editor** – Word-style UI for inserting sections, equations, images, and more
- 📤 **Export Options** – Download as `.typ`, `.pdf`, `.html`, or zipped project
- 📁 **Built-in Templates** – Quickly start with pre-made document templates (e.g., academic papers, CVs)
- 🔌 **Extensible Architecture** – Open-source and modular, ready for plugins and custom templates

## 🧠 Why Latte?

Typst is powerful but can be intimidating. Latte bridges the gap:

- For experienced users: it's a flexible Overleaf-like platform with full code control.
- For beginners: it provides Word-style controls that generate Typst behind the scenes.

Latte helps you **focus on content — not syntax**.
